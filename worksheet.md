Clone this repository (well done!)

# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide? Which is better?
  * These are web-based version control and collaboration platforms for software developers. In my opinion, Github is better as I'm more familiar with it.
  * Who made the last commit to repository A?
  * Matt on 9th of July, 2021
  * Who made the first commit to repository A?
  * Jon Mountjoy on 11t of August, 2014
  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?
  * Dave Pearce
  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?
  * Both projects are active at the moment.
  * ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?
  * I would say for the bitbucket project it has to be the **app.py** file

# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints

Red vs. Blue
